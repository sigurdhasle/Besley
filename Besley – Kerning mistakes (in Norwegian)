Regrettably it is impossible (or extremely difficult) to use in Norwegian. We have three special letters – æ, ø and å. I find these letters in the font, and the kerning regarding the å and Å is ok as far as I can see. But in some of the weights there is not enough space after the æ, and in most of the weights there is much too much space to the right of the ø.

The slash through the ø is supposed to go through the middle of the letter. It does not always do that.
